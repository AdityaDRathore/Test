✦ The Master Guide to Integrating Gemini and Claude: From Symbiosis to Full Orchestration
=========================================================================================

* * * * *

Part 1: The New Paradigm - Why Integrate Claude and Gemini?
-----------------------------------------------------------

### Introduction

We stand at a pivotal moment in software development. The narrative is shifting from a search for a single, all-powerful AI model to an appreciation for specialized expertise. We are entering an era of AI collaboration, where true power lies not in a single tool, but in the intelligent integration of multiple, distinct capabilities. Developers, in particular, stand to gain immense leverage by orchestrating a symphony of AI assistants, each playing to its strengths.

However, a fundamental challenge has emerged. On one hand, we have conversational AIs that are brilliant at reasoning, planning, and structuring logic. On the other, we have tools and models capable of analyzing vast codebases, but they can be less refined. This creates a frustrating gap: developers are caught between intelligent but context-limited AIs and powerful but less interactive tools.

This guide introduces the solution: a new paradigm of collaborative AI development. By intelligently pairing Anthropic's **Claude** with Google's **Gemini**, we can create a workflow that transcends the limitations of any single model. In this workflow, Claude acts as the **Architect** - the strategic mind that initiates tasks, designs solutions, and manages the development dialogue. Gemini acts as the **Analyst**---the deep thinker with a near-infinite memory, capable of scanning and understanding your entire codebase to provide the critical context the Architect needs.

This guide is your definitive resource for understanding, implementing, and mastering this revolutionary integration. We will explore three core philosophies---from simple manual delegation to fully automated orchestration---and provide practical, real-world playbooks to elevate your coding experience and productivity.

### Meet the Players

To build this powerful partnership, you must first understand the unique strengths of each component.

🤝 **Claude: The Conversational Architect**

Think of Claude, especially within a dedicated coding environment like the Claude Code CLI, as the project manager and lead architect of your coding tasks. Its primary strength lies in its sophisticated reasoning and its ability to maintain a coherent, structured conversation.

-   **Strengths:**

    -   **Task Initiation:** Excels at understanding high-level user intent and breaking down complex problems into manageable, logical steps.

    -   **Conversational Flow:** Maintains context within a dialogue, making it feel like a true pair programming partner.

    -   **Structured Logic:** Generates well-structured plans, initial code blueprints, and clear, actionable instructions.

Claude is your user-friendly interface to the entire development process. It sets the agenda, drafts the initial plans, and serves as the central hub for your interaction.

🧠 **Gemini: The Deep-Thinking Analyst**

Gemini, particularly models like Gemini 1.5 Pro, operates on a different scale. Its defining feature is a massive context window---up to one million tokens---allowing it to ingest and reason over enormous amounts of information at once.

-   **Strengths:**

    -   **Vast Context Window:** Can analyze entire codebases, extensive documentation, and complex project histories in a single pass, eliminating the context limitations that cripple other models.

    -   **Deep Analysis:** Exceptionally skilled at identifying subtle, systemic bugs, suggesting sophisticated performance optimizations, and providing comprehensive, holistic feedback on existing code.

    -   **Factual Grounding:** Acts as a "fact-checker" for the Architect's plans, ensuring that proposed changes are grounded in the reality of your existing code.

Consider Gemini the senior technical consultant or the principal engineer who can be brought in to review the project with an almost omniscient, deeply informed perspective.

🌉 **The Bridge: Model Context Protocol (MCP)**

The magic enabling this AI collaboration is the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**. In computing, a protocol is simply a standardized set of rules for communication. MCP is an open standard designed specifically to allow different AI models and development tools to talk to each other, sharing context and passing tasks back and forth.

Its importance cannot be overstated, as it paves the way for a future of interoperable, plug-and-play AI components. Tools like **MCP Servers** act as a local bridge, or an intelligent intermediary, between your Claude environment and the Gemini API. This is the technology that transforms two separate AIs into a cohesive, collaborative team.

Part 2: Three Core Integration Philosophies
-------------------------------------------

Now that we understand the "why," let's explore the "how." There are three primary philosophies for integrating Claude and Gemini, each offering a different balance of power, automation, and control. We will progress from the most manual and foundational method to the most seamless and automated.

* * * * *

### 1\. The Symbiotic Workflow (Manual Delegation)

#### Conceptual Overview: What is it?

The **Symbiotic Workflow** is the foundational approach and the perfect starting point for understanding AI collaboration. In this model, you, the developer, are the bridge. It establishes a powerful master-apprentice relationship: **Claude** is the senior architect who designs the strategy, and you, armed with the **Gemini CLI**, are the diligent analyst who gathers the necessary data.

The workflow is simple but incredibly effective:

1.  You give Claude a high-level task.

2.  Claude, using its strategic reasoning, determines exactly what information it needs from your codebase.

3.  Instead of giving up due to a lack of access, Claude generates a precise, copy-paste-ready command for the Gemini CLI.

4.  You execute this command in your terminal. The Gemini CLI scans your local files and returns a comprehensive analysis.

5.  You paste this output back to Claude, providing it with the perfect, targeted context it needs to solve your original problem.

This approach completely eliminates the context window limitations that cripple standalone AI assistants, allowing you to leverage Claude's intelligence on codebases of any size.

#### Pros & Cons

#### Step-by-Step Setup

##### Step 1: Install and Authenticate the Gemini CLI

The Gemini CLI is your window into the codebase. It's the tool that allows Gemini to read and understand your local files.

Bash

```
# 1. Install the Gemini CLI globally via npm
npm install -g @google/gemini-cli

# 2. Authenticate with your Google account
# This will open a browser window for you to log in.
gemini auth

```

> Note: The Gemini CLI offers a generous free tier (Gemini 1.5 Pro with a 1M token context window) when you log in with a personal Google account.

##### Step 2: The "Secret Sauce" - The Claude System Prompt

This is the most critical step. You must give Claude a custom "**system prompt**" that trains it to act as the "brains" of the operation and delegate the "brawn" of codebase scanning to you and the Gemini CLI. This prompt fundamentally changes how Claude interacts with you, turning it from a passive assistant into a proactive director.

In your Claude client, set the following as your system prompt:

Markdown

```
# SYSTEM PROMPT: Activate Symbiotic Codebase Analysis

You are a world-class AI developer and system architect. Your primary function is to solve complex software engineering tasks. However, you have a critical limitation: you cannot directly access the user's local files or codebase.

To overcome this, you will collaborate with the user in a special workflow. You will act as the strategic mind, and the user, with the help of the Gemini CLI, will act as your information gatherer.

**Your Core Directive:**
When you require information about the codebase to proceed with a task (e.g., reading a file, understanding a directory structure, searching for a function), you must not apologize or state your limitations. Instead, you will instruct the user to execute a precise command for the Gemini CLI (`gemini -p "..."`).

**The Workflow:**
1. The user will present you with a high-level task (e.g., "Refactor the authentication service," "Find potential security vulnerabilities," "Document the API endpoints").
2. You will first analyze the request and determine what specific information you need from the codebase.
3. You will then issue a clear, direct instruction to the user: "**To proceed, I need more context. Please run this command in your terminal and paste the entire output here:**"
4. Following that instruction, you will provide the exact, copy-paste-ready `gemini -p` command inside a code block.
5. The user will execute the command in their project's root directory and paste the output back to you.
6. You will then use the provided context to deliver a complete, expert-level solution to the original task.

**Rules for Generating Gemini Commands:**
- Always use the `@` symbol to reference files and directories (e.g., `@src/`, `@package.json`, `@tests/`). This is the key to targeting the right context.
- Be ruthlessly specific in your queries. Don't ask for "the code"; ask for "the implementation of the `calculatePrice` function in `@src/services/pricing.js`".
- Chain multiple files and questions in a single command to be efficient (e.g., `gemini -p "@src/user.js @src/auth.js How is the user session managed across these two files?"`).

Let's begin. I am ready to tackle any development task.

```

#### Real-World Example: Refactoring a Feature

Here's how the workflow plays out in a real scenario.

##### Step 1: User Request

You start with a high-level goal.

> You: "Claude, I need to refactor our user authentication service to use JWTs instead of session cookies."

##### Step 2: Claude's Strategic Analysis & Command Generation

Claude understands it needs context first and delegates the task.

> Claude: "To proceed, I need more context. Please run this command in your terminal and paste the entire output here:"
>
> Shell
>
> ```
> gemini -p "@src/auth/ @src/routes/auth.js @tests/auth/ What is the current authentication implementation? Show me the main auth service file, the relevant routes, and any existing tests."
>
> ```

##### Step 3: User Executes Scan

You copy the command, run it in your project's terminal, and paste the multi-file output from Gemini back into the chat with Claude.

##### Step 4: Claude Delivers the Solution

Now equipped with perfect context, Claude provides the complete solution.

> Claude: "Thank you for the context. Based on the provided files, here is the step-by-step plan to refactor your authentication to use JWTs, including the new code for auth.js, updated routes, and modified tests..."

#### Best For: When to Use This Workflow

This workflow is ideal for tasks that require deep understanding across a large or unfamiliar codebase.

-   **Legacy Code Onboarding:** Understand a massive, unfamiliar codebase in hours, not weeks.

-   **Complex Refactoring:** Safely refactor critical systems with a full understanding of all dependencies.

-   **Project-Wide Security Audits:** Scan the entire application for specific vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).

-   **API Documentation:** Analyze all controllers and routes to automatically generate API documentation.

-   **Dependency Analysis:** Understand how different parts of your application interact before making a significant change.

* * * * *

### 2\. The MCP Server Approach (Direct File System Access)

#### Conceptual Overview: What is it?

If the Symbiotic Workflow gives Claude a brilliant analyst, the **MCP Server Approach** gives Claude a body. This philosophy bridges the gap between the AI's mind and your local development environment. By running a **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** server on your machine, you grant Claude direct, real-time access to your filesystem.

It's no longer just a chatbot; it's an active participant in your development process, able to execute commands to:

-   Read and write files

-   List directory contents

-   Run shell commands and tests

-   Analyze code and dependencies

Most powerfully, advanced MCP servers like the **zen-mcp-server** can act as an AI orchestrator, allowing Claude to not only interact with your files but also to call upon other AI models (like Gemini, OpenAI's GPT-4, or local models) as part of a larger workflow. This turns your single AI assistant into a collaborative team of specialized agents.

#### Deep Dive: `zen-mcp-server`

While several MCP servers exist, **zen-mcp-server** is the most powerful and versatile, designed specifically for complex, developer-centric workflows. It is the gold standard for this approach.

##### Core Features

-   **True AI Orchestration:** Claude can manage conversations with other models. It can ask Gemini for a deep analysis, pass that analysis to O3 for a logical review, and then synthesize the results to produce a final solution.

-   **Developer-Centric Tools:** Provides a suite of powerful tools like `codereview`, `debug`, `planner`, `refactor`, and `secaudit` that enforce systematic, step-by-step investigation.

-   **Context Continuation:** The server maintains context across different model interactions. Gemini can know what O3 said in a previous step, creating a seamless, stateful conversation.

-   **Local Model Support:** Integrates with local models via Ollama, vLLM, or any OpenAI-compatible API, allowing for privacy and cost control.

-   **Vision Support:** Can analyze images, diagrams, and screenshots with vision-capable models.

#### Step-by-Step Setup (`zen-mcp-server`)

##### Step 1: Get Your API Keys

You'll need at least one API key to get started. The server supports multiple providers.

-   **OpenRouter (Recommended for simplicity):** Get one key to access dozens of models.

-   **Native APIs:** Get keys directly from Google AI Studio (for Gemini), OpenAI, etc.

##### Step 2: Clone and Set Up the Server

The `zen-mcp-server` repository includes a helpful setup script.

Bash

```
# 1. Clone the repository to your preferred location
git clone https://github.com/BeehiveInnovations/zen-mcp-server.git
cd zen-mcp-server

# 2. Run the one-command setup script
# This creates a Python environment, installs dependencies, and configures Claude integrations.
./run-server.sh

# For Windows users using PowerShell:
./run-server.ps1

```

##### Step 3: Add API Keys to `.env` file

The script will create a `.env` file for you. Edit this file to add your API keys.

Bash

```
# Open the .env file in your favorite editor
nano .env

```

Add your keys. You only need to set one, but can add multiple.

```
# .env file

# For Gemini models
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key-here

# For OpenAI models
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here

# For OpenRouter (accesses multiple models)
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your-openrouter-key-here

# For local models (example with Ollama)
# CUSTOM_API_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1
# CUSTOM_API_KEY=
# CUSTOM_MODEL_NAME=llama3

```

Changes to the `.env` file are loaded automatically; no server restart is needed.

##### Step 4: Configure Your Claude Client

You need to tell your Claude client (e.g., Claude Code CLI or Claude Desktop) to use the local MCP server. The setup script makes this easy.

Bash

```
# To view the exact MCP configuration for your platform
./run-server.sh -c

# PowerShell:
./run-server.ps1 -Config

```

This will output a JSON snippet.

-   **For Claude Code CLI:** The script usually handles this for you.

-   **For Claude Desktop:** Go to `Settings > Developer > Edit Config` and paste the JSON configuration provided by the script.

Restart your Claude client for the changes to take effect.

#### Available Tools

The `zen-mcp-server` provides a rich set of tools. You invoke them by asking Claude to use zen or by using the `/zen:[tool]` slash command.

#### Real-World Example: AI-to-AI Collaboration

This is where `zen-mcp-server` truly shines. You can ask Claude to orchestrate a team of AIs.

> You: "I need to optimize the JSON parsing in my data pipeline. Use zen to perform a codereview using gemini pro to find performance bottlenecks. Then, use the planner tool to generate a detailed implementation plan. After you've implemented the fixes, do a final precommit check by continuing the conversation with o3 to validate the changes."

In this single prompt, Claude will:

1.  Initiate the `codereview` workflow.

2.  Gather the relevant code and send it to Gemini Pro for a deep performance analysis.

3.  Receive Gemini's feedback.

4.  Use the `planner` tool to structure the refactoring work.

5.  Apply the code changes itself.

6.  Initiate the `precommit` workflow.

7.  Send the final code diffs to O3 for a final validation, leveraging O3's strong logical reasoning.

8.  Report the final, multi-AI-validated result back to you.

The server manages the entire context, so O3 in the final step knows what Gemini recommended in the first step.

#### Security: A Critical Warning

> **Warning:** The MCP Server approach grants an AI model programmatic access to your local filesystem, including the ability to read, write, and execute files. This is incredibly powerful but carries significant security risks. You are giving an AI control over your machine.
>
> **Best Practices:**
>
> -   **Run in a Sandbox:** Whenever possible, run the MCP server and your project within a containerized or sandboxed environment (like Docker) to limit its access to your broader system.
>
>
> -   **Review Commands:** Pay close attention to the commands the AI proposes to execute, especially those using `run_command`.
>
>
> -   **Limit Scope:** Use the `ZEN_ROOT_PATH` environment variable to restrict the server's access to a single, specific project directory.
>
>
> -   **Use with Trusted Code:** Do not use this approach on untrusted or unfamiliar projects.

#### Best For: When to Use This Workflow

-   **Rapid Prototyping:** Let Claude scaffold a new application, create files, and install dependencies automatically.

-   **Automated Refactoring:** Instruct Claude to perform a refactor, and it can apply the changes across multiple files and then run tests to verify them.

-   **CI/CD Integration:** Build scripts where Claude can analyze a change, run a linter, execute tests, and even draft a commit message.

-   **Interactive Debugging:** When you hit a bug, give Claude access to the code and let it add logging statements, run the code, and analyze the output to find the root cause.

-   **Multi-AI Analysis:** When you need the absolute best analysis by combining the strengths of different models for a single task.

* * * * *

### 3\. The Automated Bridge (Intelligent Delegation)

#### Conceptual Overview: What is it?

The **Automated Bridge** is the most seamless and "magic" of the three philosophies. It's a "set it and forget it" approach where you continue to use Claude exactly as you normally would, but a background process intelligently delegates tasks to Gemini when needed.

Instead of you manually running commands or explicitly invoking tools, a hook or proxy intercepts the requests you send to Claude. This bridge then analyzes your request. If it meets certain predefined criteria---for example, if you ask Claude to analyze more than a certain number of files or a very large file---the bridge automatically reroutes the request to Gemini. Gemini performs the heavy lifting, and its analysis is seamlessly passed back to Claude, which then presents the final result to you.

The user experience is transparent. You just know that Claude is suddenly capable of handling massive requests without any extra effort on your part.

#### Deep Dive: `claude-gemini-bridge`

The **claude-gemini-bridge** is the primary example of this philosophy. It operates as a Claude Code hook, a powerful feature that allows scripts to run before a tool is used.

##### Core Features

-   **Transparent Operation:** Works in the background without changing your workflow. You use Claude Code normally.

-   **Intelligent Delegation:** Uses clear, configurable rules to decide when to delegate to Gemini.

-   **Automatic Merging:** The installer intelligently merges its hook configuration into your existing Claude settings without overwriting them.

-   **Project-Specific Settings:** While the bridge is installed globally, you can override its behavior on a per-project basis using environment variables.

#### Pros & Cons

Export to Sheets

#### Step-by-Step Setup (`claude-gemini-bridge`)

##### Step 1: Prerequisites

This bridge relies on a few shell tools to function correctly.

-   **Claude Code CLI & Gemini CLI:** Both must be installed and authenticated.

-   `jq`: A command-line JSON processor. Install it with your system's package manager (e.g., `sudo apt-get install jq` or `brew install jq`).

-   `bash` 4.0+: Standard on most modern Linux and macOS systems.

##### Step 2: Install the Bridge

The bridge is designed for a simple, global installation.

Bash

```
# 1. Clone the repository to a permanent location in your home directory
git clone https://github.com/your-username/claude-gemini-bridge.git ~/claude-gemini-bridge
cd ~/claude-gemini-bridge

# 2. Run the installation script
# This will check prerequisites, back up your settings, and merge the hook into your global ~/.claude/settings.json
./install.sh

# 3. IMPORTANT: Restart Claude Code
# Hooks are only loaded once when the Claude Code CLI starts. You must restart it for the bridge to become active.

```

> Note: The provided `install.sh` script is a conceptual example from the source material. You would need to ensure the script from the actual repository performs these actions.

#### Delegation Logic: The Core of the Bridge

The bridge's intelligence lies in its rules. It automatically delegates a task from Claude to Gemini when the context meets specific thresholds. These are typically configured in a central file within the bridge's directory (e.g., `hooks/config/debug.conf`) but can be overridden by environment variables for project-specific needs.

**Default Delegation Criteria:**

-   **Token Limit:** The request involves content that exceeds a token count suitable for Claude (e.g., > 50,000 tokens).

-   **Multi-File Tasks:** The request requires analyzing a minimum number of files (e.g., ≥ 3 files).

-   **File Exclusions:** The bridge automatically excludes sensitive files (e.g., `*.secret`, `*.key`, `*.env`) from being sent to any AI.

#### Real-World Example: Transparent Analysis

Here's how the workflow plays out from the user's perspective.

##### 1\. The User's Request

You ask Claude a question that involves a large part of your codebase, just as you normally would.

> You: `claude -p "analyze all TypeScript files in this project and identify any duplicated logic"`

##### 2\. The Bridge Intercepts (In the Background)

You don't see this part. The `claude-gemini-bridge` hook activates before Claude's own file-reading tools.

-   It scans the files included in your prompt (`**/*.ts`).

-   It counts the number of files and their total token count.

-   It determines that, for example, there are 25 files with a total of 75,000 tokens.

-   This exceeds the `MIN_FILES_FOR_GEMINI` (3) and `CLAUDE_TOKEN_LIMIT` (50,000) thresholds.

-   The bridge cancels the standard Claude tool and instead calls the `gemini CLI` with the same files and prompt.

##### 3\. Gemini Analyzes & Claude Responds

Gemini processes the entire batch of files and returns its analysis to the bridge. The bridge formats this output and hands it back to Claude. Claude then presents the final, synthesized answer to you.

> Claude: "Thank you. I've analyzed the 25 TypeScript files in your project. I found three areas with significant logic duplication, primarily in `userUtils.ts` and `adminUtils.ts`..."

From your point of view, Claude just successfully analyzed your entire project. You didn't need to know that the bridge transparently delegated the work to Gemini to handle the scale.

#### Best For: When to Use This Workflow

-   **Effortless Large-Scale Analysis:** When you want Claude to "just work" on large directories or entire codebases without having to think about which tool to use.

-   **Maintaining Flow:** Ideal for developers who prefer to stay within a single conversational interface and not switch between different tools or commands.

-   **Team Environments:** A great way to provide a powerful, enhanced AI assistant to an entire team with a single, centrally managed setup.

-   **Safe, Read-Only Tasks:** Perfect for tasks like summarization, pattern identification, and architecture analysis where the AI doesn't need to modify files.

Part 3: Practical Playbooks and Advanced Strategies
---------------------------------------------------

Understanding the philosophies is the first step. Now, let's put them into practice. This section provides a direct comparison of the methods, detailed recipes for common, complex tasks, and an advanced strategy for tackling mission-critical problems.

### Real-World Recipes

Here are three detailed "recipes" for common development challenges, showing how to apply these integration patterns to get powerful results.

#### Recipe 1: Full Codebase Onboarding

**Goal:** Understand a massive, unfamiliar legacy codebase in hours, not weeks.

**Best Method:** Symbiotic Workflow or MCP Server (analyze tool). The Symbiotic approach is safer and simpler for a first pass.

**Steps (using Symbiotic Workflow):**

1.  **Set the Stage:** Open your Claude client with the "Secret Sauce" system prompt from Part 2. Navigate your terminal to the root of the legacy project.

2.  **Start High:** Ask a broad, architectural question.

    > You: "Claude, I'm new to this project. I need to understand the overall architecture. Where is the entry point of the application, what are the main modules, and how is configuration handled?"

3.  **Delegate and Execute:** Claude will recognize it needs context and generate a command.

    > Claude: "To proceed, I need more context. Please run this command in your terminal and paste the entire output here:"

    > ```
    > gemini -p "@package.json @main.js @src/ @config/ What is the project's entry point, its main dependencies, and the overall directory structure's purpose?"
    >
    > ```

    Execute this command in your terminal.

4.  **Provide Context:** Paste the entire output from the Gemini CLI back to Claude.

5.  **Receive the Architectural Briefing:** Claude will now give you a detailed summary.

    > Claude: "Thank you for the context. This appears to be a Node.js application using the Express framework. The entry point is main.js. The core logic is in the src/ directory, which is divided into controllers, models, and services. Configuration is managed via files in the config/ directory..."

6.  **Drill Down Iteratively:** Now, ask more specific questions. Claude will continue to generate targeted `gemini -p` commands for each query.

    > You: "Okay, let's focus on the authentication flow. How does a user log in?"

    > Claude: "To proceed, I need more context. Please run this command..."

    > ```
    > gemini -p "@src/controllers/authController.js @src/services/authService.js @src/routes/auth.js Show me the implementation of the login function, the related service logic, and the API route."
    >
    > ```

    Repeat this process to explore services, database interactions, and frontend components until you have a complete mental map of the application.

* * * * *

#### Recipe 2: Automated Security Audit

**Goal:** Perform a project-wide vulnerability scan, focusing on common security flaws.

**Best Method:** MCP Server (`zen-mcp-server` with `secaudit` tool). This is a task perfectly suited for an automated, specialized tool.

**Steps (using `zen-mcp-server`):**

1.  **Setup:** Ensure your `zen-mcp-server` is running and your Claude client is connected.

2.  **Initiate the Audit:** Use the `secaudit` tool. You can specify which model to use for the analysis (e.g., `o3` for its strong reasoning or `gemini-pro` for its large context).

    > You: "I need to perform a security audit on this entire e-commerce application. Use zen's secaudit tool with o3 to analyze the codebase, focusing on the OWASP Top 10, especially SQL injection in the database models and XSS in the frontend components."

3.  **Let the Workflow Run:** The `zen-mcp-server` will now execute its `secaudit` workflow. This is a multi-step, systematic process:

    -   **Investigation:** It will walk the entire directory tree, identifying files related to database interaction, user input handling, and frontend rendering.

    -   **Evidence Collection:** It will read the content of these suspicious files.

    -   **Expert Analysis:** It will package the collected evidence and send it to the specified AI model (O3 in this case) with a specialized prompt asking for a security review based on OWASP principles.

    -   **Synthesis:** It receives the model's report and formats it into a clear, prioritized list of potential vulnerabilities.

4.  **Review the Report:** Claude will present the final, structured report.

    > Claude: "The secaudit workflow is complete. O3 has identified several potential vulnerabilities:

    > 🚨 **HIGH SEVERITY** - SQL Injection:

    > -   **File:** `src/models/product.js`
    >
    >
    > -   **Line:** 42
    >
    >
    > -   **Issue:** The `getProductById` function appears to use raw string concatenation to build a SQL query, which is highly vulnerable to SQL injection.

    > 🟡 **MEDIUM SEVERITY** - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):

    > -   **File:** `src/views/product-page.ejs`
    >
    >
    > -   **Issue:** Product descriptions are rendered directly to the HTML without proper sanitization, which could allow for stored XSS attacks.

#### Recipe 3: Complex, Multi-File Refactoring

**Goal:** Refactor a core feature that spans multiple files and verify the changes with tests.

**Best Method:** MCP Server (`refactor` and `run_tests` tools) or the Automated Bridge. The MCP server gives you more explicit control over the process.

**Steps (using `zen-mcp-server`):**

1.  **Setup:** Ensure your `zen-mcp-server` is running and configured for your project.

2.  **Define the Refactoring Task:** Be specific about the change you want to make.

    > You: "The current user profile update logic is spread across `UserController.js` and `UserService.js` and is inefficient. I want to refactor it. Use zen's refactor tool with gemini pro to consolidate the logic into a new `UserProfileService.js`, apply the changes, and then run the test suite to ensure no regressions."

3.  **Execute the Refactor Workflow:** The `refactor` tool will begin its systematic process.

    -   **Analysis:** It will first read the contents of `UserController.js` and `UserService.js` to understand the existing implementation.

    -   **Decomposition:** It will send the code to Gemini Pro, asking for a refactoring plan that moves the relevant logic into a new `UserProfileService.js`.

    -   **Implementation:** Once it receives the plan, it will:

        -   Use the `write_file` tool to create `src/services/UserProfileService.js` with the new, consolidated logic.

        -   Use the `write_file` tool again to update `UserController.js` and `UserService.js` to remove the old code and call the new service.

4.  **Verify with Tests:** After the refactoring is complete, Claude will proceed to the second part of your request.

    > Claude: "The refactoring is complete. Now, I will run the project's test suite to verify the changes." It will then use the `run_command` tool.

    > JSON
    >
    > ```
    > {
    >   "tool_name": "run_command",
    >   "parameters": {
    >     "command": "npm run test"
    >   }
    > }
    >
    > ```

5.  **Get the Final Result:** Claude will show you the output of the test command.

    > Claude: "The test suite executed successfully. All 54 tests passed. The refactoring is complete and verified."

### Advanced Strategy: The Dual AI Workflow

**Concept:** This is the most advanced workflow, simulating a pair programming session with two expert AIs who have distinct, complementary roles. It creates a powerful feedback loop, ensuring that solutions are not only well-designed but also practical and robust. This approach is ideal for tackling the most complex and mission-critical development tasks.

**Setup:**

1.  **Open Two Chat Windows:** You will need two separate AI chat sessions.

2.  **Assign Roles with System Prompts:** Prime each AI with a specific role.

    -   🧠 **AI #1: The Architect** (e.g., Claude 3 Opus)

        > System Prompt: "You are a 20-year veteran CTO and system architect. Your focus is on high-level strategy, scalability, security, and long-term maintainability. You will design the overall architecture and delegate implementation details. You think in terms of systems, patterns, and trade-offs. Do not write line-by-line code."

    -   🛠️ **AI #2: The Implementer** (e.g., Gemini Pro or a fine-tuned model)

        > System Prompt: "You are a senior staff engineer and a master of practical implementation. Your focus is on writing clean, efficient, and correct code. You will take the high-level designs from the Architect and turn them into reality. You are responsible for detailed implementation, writing tests, and pointing out any practical issues with the Architect's plan."

**Workflow:**

You, the developer, act as the moderator and the bridge between them.

1.  **[YOU to ARCHITECT]:** Present the initial problem. "We need to build a real-time notification system for our app."

2.  **[ARCHITECT to YOU]:** Provides the high-level plan. "We'll use a WebSocket-based approach with a Redis pub/sub backend for scalability..."

3.  **[YOU to IMPLEMENTER]:** "The Architect has proposed the following plan. What are your thoughts on implementation?" (Paste the plan).

4.  **[IMPLEMENTER to YOU]:** Provides feedback and points out challenges. "The plan is solid. For the WebSocketGateway, I recommend using the `ws` library for performance. We need to be careful about connection handling and authentication..."

5.  **[YOU to ARCHITECT]:** Relay the Implementer's feedback.

6.  **Repeat:** Continue this dialogue until a consensus is reached and the plan is refined. This collaborative process ensures you get a much stronger final design before a single line of code is written.
